# Dimension Replan Status

Tracks per-session progress for `2026-05-28-dimension-replan-design.md`.

## R0 probe results (2026-05-28)

- Probe 1 (single vm_compute is_refl): instantaneous
- Probe 2 (sublists 4 all_pairs length): instantaneous
- Probe 3 (filter is_refl over 12650 sublists): instantaneous
- **Total elapsed time: 3.244 seconds**

**Decision:** GO

vm_compute completes the full 12650-sublist reflection check in under 4 seconds. Reflection approach is viable for closing admits in dimension theory.

## R1 results (2026-05-28)

- Implementation: split into 2 files for fast iteration.
  - `posets/dimension/N5Exhaustive/N5Reflect.v` (271 lines) — defs + cheap lemmas (~1.5s compile).
  - `posets/dimension/N5Exhaustive/N5Reflect_Exhaustive.v` (81 lines) — `exhaustive_4edge_decidable` + `exhaustive_4edge` (Qed via `native_cast_no_check`).
- Commit: `4c57ebe`.
- Admit count: 3 (unchanged; reductions happen in R3 wire-in).
- Lessons: monolithic file would have a slow vm_compute. Split made iteration fast. Switched to `native_cast_no_check` from `vm_cast_no_check` for ~10× kernel-recheck speedup.
